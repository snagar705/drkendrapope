Plants have long been used to treat symptoms, illnesses and disease. Herbal medicine, or botanical medicine, refers to the use of a plantâ€™s seeds, berries, roots, leaves, bark, or flowers for their medicinal purposes. Depending on the medicinal compounds we are interested in using from the plant, different formulations may be recommended or prescribed. Some of the forms in which we use herbs include; Fresh, Dried, Teas, Powder, Capsule, Tablet, Tincture, Cream or Salve.
